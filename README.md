Reducing dimensionality in Breast Cancer Dataset

# Introduction 
Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is a dimensionality-reduction method that is used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

Smaller data sets are easier to explore and visualize and make analyzing data much easier and faster for machine learning algorithms without large set of variables to process. So the idea of PCA is simply to reduce the number of variables of a data set, while preserving as much information as possible.
