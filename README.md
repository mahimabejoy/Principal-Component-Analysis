# Principal-Component-Analysis
Reducing dimensionality in Breast Cancer Dataset

# Introduction 
Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is a dimensionality-reduction method that is used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

Smaller data sets are easier to explore and visualize and make analyzing data much easier and faster for machine learning algorithms without large set of variables to process. So the idea of PCA is simply to reduce the number of variables of a data set, while preserving as much information as possible.

# Steps used in this Project

1. Standardization 

The StandardScalar module is used here to scale down the values as the difference between the values should be minimal to create a new vectorspace

2. Appy PCA Technique

Using PCA module the dimentionality reduction can be performed

3. Data Visualization 

The reduced dimension data can be plotted using the matplot library preserving the information
